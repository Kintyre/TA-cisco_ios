1. Create a UDP input on one of your Splunk servers or a forwarder with sourcetype set to *syslog* or *cisco:ios*. A regex match will be performed to rewrite the events to the cisco:ios sourcetype.
2. Configure your Cisco devices to send their syslogs to the UDP input created in step 2 with logging level informational.

1. Step 4 to 6: OPTIONAL for Smart Call Home support

1. OPTIONAL - Add a new TCP data input on a port of your choice, set sourcetype to Cisco:SmartCallHome

1. OPTIONAL - On your Cisco devices:

        service call-home
        call-home
        contact-email-addr YOUR.EMAIL@ADDR.ESS
        site-id "YOUR_SITE_NAME"
        profile "Splunk"
        destination transport-method http
        destination address http http://SPLUNK.SERVER.IP:TCP_PORT_FROM_STEP_4
        subscribe-to-alert-group diagnostic severity debug
        subscribe-to-alert-group environment severity debug
